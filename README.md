# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Robby Agustino

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate IT student with a focus on cloud computing, web development, and application deployment. I love building projects that solve real-world problems and learning new technologies along the way.

## ðŸš€ Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

### Website Deployment & FTP Tool
Currently in development, this application will enable instant deployment of websites for FTP purposes, allowing clients to access them via a browser without the need for software installation. It can be accessed globally using cloud services as a gateway, so that the host does not expose their IP directly.

### [InstantSite](https://github.com/rotinoo/instant-site)
A simple application for easy website deployment on local servers. Part of a larger project aimed at simplifying website sharing.

### [Personal Bio Website](https://github.com/rotinoo/my-portofolio)
A personal website showcasing my skills, experience, and projects in IT, with a focus on cloud computing and web development.
